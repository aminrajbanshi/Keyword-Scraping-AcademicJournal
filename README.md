# Keyword-Scraping-AcademicJournal
This Keyword Scraping program specifically used for Academic Journals was developed during a group project at University.  
Wouldn't have been possible without the help of my group members, so a thank you for their contributions too.  
#### The Idea  
The idea behind this scraping program is based on keywords.  
Since it is targeted towards academic journals and the re/formatting of similar papers, I have created a program that searches for keywords such as 'Title', 'Abstract', 'Figures', and 'References' and scrapes the specified number of words before and after each keyword.  
The ultimate goal is to make the life of journal reformatters a lot less tedious.  
Hope you enjoy :)
